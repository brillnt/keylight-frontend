- [ ] Configure build and deployment pipeline
- [ ] Set up development environment

### 2.2 Form Migration
- [ ] Convert multi-step form to Angular reactive forms
- [ ] Migrate validation logic to Angular validators
- [ ] Implement step navigation with Angular routing
- [ ] Convert CSS to Angular component styles

### 2.3 Service Layer Creation
- [ ] Create API service for backend communication
- [ ] Create form state management service
- [ ] Create validation service
- [ ] Create configuration service (matching current config.js)

### 2.4 Feature Parity & Testing
- [ ] Ensure all current functionality works identically
- [ ] Test conditional field logic in Angular
- [ ] Verify API integration works correctly
- [ ] Performance comparison with current form

### 2.5 Deployment & Transition
- [ ] Deploy Angular version alongside current form
- [ ] A/B testing between versions
- [ ] Complete transition to Angular version
- [ ] Archive old HTML/JS version

**Success Criteria:**
- Feature parity with current form
- Improved maintainability and extensibility
- Same or better performance
- Smooth deployment transition

## ðŸŸ¡ Phase 3: Basic Admin Dashboard (NEEDS DISCUSSION)
**Goal:** Create admin interface for managing submissions

**Status:** Requires planning discussion
**Estimated Time:** TBD based on scope decisions

### Outstanding Questions:
1. **Authentication & Authorization:**
   - What authentication method? (Simple password, OAuth, JWT?)
   - Single admin or multiple user roles?
   - Session management approach?

2. **Core Admin Features Priority:**
   - Which features are must-have vs. nice-to-have?
   - Submission listing and filtering requirements?
   - Bulk operations needed?
   - Export functionality requirements?

3. **ClickUp Integration Level:**
   - Just links to ClickUp tasks or embedded data?
   - Real-time status updates vs. manual refresh?
   - How much ClickUp data to cache locally?

4. **UI/UX Approach:**
   - Table-based interface or card-based?
   - Mobile admin access requirements?
   - Dashboard vs. detailed views priority?

### Potential Features (To Be Prioritized):
- [ ] Submission listing with search/filter
- [ ] Individual submission detail views
- [ ] Status management and updates
- [ ] ClickUp task integration display
- [ ] Basic analytics and reporting
- [ ] User management (if multi-user)
- [ ] Settings and configuration management

## ðŸ”´ Phase 4+: Advanced Features (UP IN THE AIR)
**Goal:** Enhanced project management and analytics features

**Status:** Requires significant planning and discussion
**Estimated Time:** TBD

### Major Outstanding Questions:

#### Project Management UI:
- Timeline/Gantt chart requirements?
- Project milestone tracking approach?
- Client-facing vs. internal-only features?
- Integration depth with ClickUp project management?

#### Analytics & Reporting:
- What metrics are most valuable?
- Real-time dashboards vs. periodic reports?
- Custom report building requirements?
- Data visualization preferences?

#### Advanced Integrations:
- Email automation integration?
- Calendar integration needs?
- Document management requirements?
- CRM integration possibilities?

#### Mobile & Accessibility:
- Mobile app requirements?
- Offline functionality needs?
- Accessibility compliance level?
- Performance requirements for large datasets?

### Potential Advanced Features (Brainstorming):
- [ ] Project timeline visualization
- [ ] Advanced analytics dashboard
- [ ] Client portal for project updates
- [ ] Automated workflow management
- [ ] Document management system
- [ ] Team collaboration features
- [ ] Mobile application
- [ ] API for third-party integrations

## Technical Considerations

### Current Tech Stack:
- **Frontend:** Angular (post-migration)
- **Styling:** CSS3, responsive design
- **API Communication:** HTTP client, RESTful APIs
- **State Management:** Angular services (may evolve to NgRx)

### Future Considerations:
- **State Management:** NgRx for complex admin features?
- **UI Framework:** Angular Material or custom components?
- **Real-time Updates:** WebSockets vs. polling?
- **Testing:** Unit, integration, and e2e testing strategies
- **Performance:** Lazy loading, caching strategies
- **Security:** XSS protection, CSRF tokens, secure API calls

   - Security requirements

### Success Metrics:

#### Phase 1:
- Zero form submission failures
- 100% field validation accuracy
- < 3 second form completion time

#### Phase 2:
- Feature parity maintained
- Improved code maintainability
- Same or better performance metrics

#### Phase 3+ (TBD):
